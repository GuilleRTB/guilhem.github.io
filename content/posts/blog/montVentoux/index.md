# Trail du Mont Ventoux with My Dad and Friend 🏔️

Mont Ventoux, also known as the *Giant of Provence*, is legendary for cyclists… but we decided to tackle it as a **trail run**. With my dad and my friend, we spent the day climbing, running, walking (okay, suffering), and enjoying an adventure we’ll never forget.

## Before the Race

The adventure started with the classic trail-run ritual: checking the route on a map, pretending we knew exactly where we were going. My dad and I squinted at the paper like explorers from another century, while my friend was already laughing at us.

## The Start: Team Spirit ✌️

The three of us set off together, full of motivation and jokes. Mont Ventoux looked massive in front of us, but spirits were high. Dad kept the pace steady, my friend wanted to sprint ahead, and I was somewhere in between trying to save energy.

## The Climb

The trail quickly reminded us who was boss: steep slopes, rocky paths, and endless climbs. The stats say it all:  
- Lots of kilometers, lots of elevation gain, and lots of sweat.  
- Heart rate: high.  
- Energy left: low.  

But every time we looked up, the views of Provence gave us a second wind. And honestly, sharing this with my dad made every hard step worth it.

## The Route

We wound our way up and around the Ventoux, passing forests, rocky ridges, and open stretches where the wind hit us like a wall. The nickname *Mont Ventoux* (“Windy Mountain”) is very real.  

At times we ran, at times we hiked, and at times we just laughed at how slow we were moving. But together, we kept going.

## The Finish 🎉

Crossing the finish line wasn’t about speed — it was about doing it **together**. The three of us finished tired, dirty, and smiling. My dad crushed it, my friend still had energy to joke, and I was mostly thinking about food.

## Reflections

Running a trail on Mont Ventoux is tough, but doing it as a team — with my dad and my buddy — made it unforgettable.  
We didn’t just conquer a mountain; we shared a memory that will stick forever.

Would I do it again? Definitely. But next time, maybe with a bit less wind… and a lot more snacks. 🍫🥪
