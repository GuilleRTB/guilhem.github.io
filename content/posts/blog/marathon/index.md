# My First Marathon in Toulouse 🎉

I finally did it — my very first marathon!  
42 km around **Toulouse**, 3h45 of running, thousands of steps… and yes, my legs still hate me.  

## Before the Race

The night before, I did what every pro runner would do: eat too much pasta, double-check my shoes 15 times, and sleep… almost nothing.  
At the starting line, I felt both nervous and excited. The crowd was buzzing, music was playing, and I thought: *“Okay, let’s just survive this thing.”*

## The First Half (fresh and optimistic)

The first 10 km flew by — Toulouse looked beautiful, and my legs felt like wings. I even smiled at the photographers (before I started suffering).  

By the halfway point, I was still doing fine. I had energy, the pace was steady, and I was even thinking: *“Marathons aren’t that bad!”* (spoiler: they are).

## The Famous Wall 🧱

Then came kilometer 30.  
If you’ve ever run long distances, you know what I’m talking about. Suddenly my legs turned into stone, every step was a negotiation, and water stations felt like oases in the desert.

## The Route

The course took us through so many parts of Toulouse — from big boulevards to small side streets, across bridges and along the Garonne. Crowds cheered us on with *“Allez, courage!”* and high fives. Honestly, their energy kept me going when mine was gone.

## The Finish 🏅

Crossing that line was pure magic. Exhausted, proud, and already forgetting the pain.  
Would I do it again?  
Ask me the day after: **no way.**  
Ask me a week later: **where do I sign up?**

## Aftermath

- Walking down stairs: impossible.  
- Sitting down: painful.  
- Standing up again: even worse.  

But after the shower, food, and medal photos, the suffering didn’t matter. I had just run my **first marathon**.  

Marathon #1: done.  
Next challenge? Who knows… but for now: beer, food, and rest. 🍕🍺
