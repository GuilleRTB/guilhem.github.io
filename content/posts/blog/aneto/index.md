# Climbing Aneto with Friends

At 3,404 meters, **Aneto** is the highest peak of the Pyrenees and a dream for many hikers and mountaineers. Together with my friends, we decided to take on this challenge: a **28 km hike with 1,505 m of elevation gain**, spread over an exhausting but rewarding **15 hours of walking**.

## The Start

We began our adventure early in the morning, under clear skies and crisp mountain air. The first few kilometers were gentle, allowing us to warm up while enjoying the scenery of the Maladeta massif.

## The Climb

The route soon became more demanding, with steep rocky paths, snow patches, and the famous **Paso de Mahoma**, a narrow ridge near the summit that requires both balance and courage. Step by step, we encouraged each other, sharing laughs, snacks, and motivation.

## The Summit

After hours of effort, we finally stood on the **summit of Aneto** â€” 3,404 meters above sea level! The view was breathtaking: the endless peaks of the Pyrenees stretching in every direction. We felt a mix of joy, relief, and pride, knowing we had pushed our limits together.

## The Descent & Reflection

The way down tested our endurance even more than the climb. Tired legs, long trails, and the weight of the day made every step heavier. But when we reached the starting point after **15 hours**, the sense of achievement was overwhelming.

This adventure was more than a physical challenge; it was about friendship, teamwork, and the unforgettable memories we created on the roof of the Pyrenees.
