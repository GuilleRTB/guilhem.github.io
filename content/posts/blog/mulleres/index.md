# Climbing Pico de Mullere — My Second 3000+ 🏔️

After Aneto, I was hungry for more Pyrenean adventures. So I went back to the same massif, this time to climb **Pico de Mullere** (3,010 m).  
It became my **second 3000+ summit**, and honestly… what a beautiful day: wild landscapes, incredible views, and lots of animal encounters.

## The Start

Fresh legs, big smiles, and the whole mountain ahead of us. The morning was cool, the sky clear, and spirits high. At the beginning of a climb, everything feels easy — little did we know what was waiting for us higher up!

## The Trail & Landscapes

The route to Pico de Mullere is less crowded than Aneto, which gave us a real feeling of wilderness. We crossed rocky ridges, alpine meadows, and endless stretches with breathtaking views of the Pyrenees.  

Nature gave us a show:  
- **Marmots** whistling as we passed.  
- **Birds of prey** soaring above.  
- **Sheep** scattered across the slopes, living their best mountain life.  

It felt like walking inside a documentary.

## Break Time

Of course, no hike is complete without a well-deserved break. We sat down, ate snacks, and just enjoyed the silence and beauty around us. These quiet moments in the mountains are often as special as reaching the summit.

## The Summit 🎉

And then — the summit of **Pico de Mullere, 3,010 m**!  
The view was spectacular: Aneto standing proudly nearby, and the Pyrenees stretching endlessly in all directions.  

Standing on top of my **second 3000+ peak** felt amazing. Less famous than Aneto, but just as rewarding — and maybe even more peaceful.

## Reflections

The climb to Mullere was about more than just altitude. It was about discovering quieter paths, enjoying wildlife encounters, and sharing another unforgettable adventure in the Pyrenees.  

Two 3000m peaks down… many more to go. 😉
